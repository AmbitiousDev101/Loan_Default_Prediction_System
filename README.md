This is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of loan default using real-world credit data. Built with scikit-learn and pandas, the system trains a high-accuracy (93%) Random Forest classifier on key financial features such as income, credit history, and loan intent. It includes a robust preprocessing pipeline using ColumnTransformer to handle scaling, encoding, and missing values. Borrower trends are visualized with matplotlib, and an interactive review interface—powered by a custom doubly linked list—enables real-time navigation of model predictions, simulating a loan officer’s risk assessment workflow.
